									<p class="leading">Joe Wexler</p>
									<p>Joe is a bassist who hails from San Diego, California. His first musical memories are of picking out tunes by ear on his parents piano at the age of 6. He began studying bass at the age of 14 and at 17 began gigging with classical and jazz piano prodigy Chase Morrin. He went on to study music, neuroscience and Chinese language at Oberlin College and Conservatory and has studied with staples of the San Diego jazz scene, including David Hilton, Rob Thorsen, Gunnar Biggs, Tommy Babin and Dean Hulett. He continues to perform regularly around the city with bands including Manouche Five, Chris Moore Trio, La Jolla Signature Jazz Combo and Human Error. His musical philosophy is to play from the heart by drawing on his own creativity and life experience while also honoring the great jazz legends of the past.</p>

									
								
								<p class="leading">Harry Rubin-Falcone</p>
									<p>Harry is a multi-instrumentalist who was born and raised in New York City. He first started playing guitar at age 9, and has picked up bass, voice, and trombone since then. He's studied music at LaGuardia High School for the performing arts in New York City and Oberlin College and Conservatory in Ohio. He's studied with great teachers like Richard Davis, Peter Dominguez, Kevin Blancq, and Neal Miner, and has shared the stage with all-stars like Slide Hampton, Les Kurtz, Steve Little, and  Jimmy Heath.</p>

									<p>Harry has been gigging in New York since 2013, playing in venues like Cleopatra's Needle, Jalopy Tavern/ School of Music, and the Shrine. His love of the great American Song Book comes through when he plays standards, as he always plays and sings with soft intensity.</p>
								
							
							
							<p class="leading">The Duo</p>
									<p>Joe and Harry met in Oberlin College and Conservatory in 2009 and have been playing music together since 2011. Their close friendship comes through in their music as a tight duo with a precise sound. They both love tasteful, classic jazz. Although both are able to play virtuosic lines on their instruments, they prefer a simple unified approach to Jazz.</p>
